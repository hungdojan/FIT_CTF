Welcome to fit-ctf's documentation!
===================================

**FIT_CTF** is a basic container-oriented CTF framework build on top of Podman and
Podman-compose. The tool is used for managing projects (or competitions) and users.

This program consists of two parts: **CLI** tool that communicates with the back-end
(logic) and the database, and **Rendezvous** tool which serves as a starting point to the
users (for user authentication and starting their nodes).
